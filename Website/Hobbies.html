<br><br>
<p style="text-align:right">I've been playing pool since I was 8 with my dad. I will never deny a game of pool if I</p> 
<p style="text-align:right">have the chance to, with nothing in my way. I don't play very often throughout the school year which makes every time I go amazing!</p>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<h3 style="text-align:right">Soccer</h3>

<br><br>
<p style="text-align:left">I am no professional, but I am always happy to play, until I get tired. I mostly got interested in soccer in middle school</p>
<p style="text-align:left">when I moved to a neighborhood where kids almost always gathered to play soccer for the fun of it, and I'd join them.</p>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<h3>Card Games</h3>

<p style="text-align:right">I have only recently gotten into card games since I didn't know many until junior year. Junior I was introduced to several fun card games.</p>
<p style="text-align:right">Including: euchre (my favorite), mau, b.s., and speed. Euchre was introduced to me at my brass band retreat junior year when there was a euchre</p>
<p style="text-align:right">tournament and I learned to join the competition, although I lost in the first round. Speed was taught to me not long after, along with b.s..</p>
<p style="text-align:right">I learned mau during the tour I went on with the brass band in Washington D.C. after a long day of touring and exploring.</p>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<h3 style="text-align:right">Video Games</h3>

<br><br>
<p style="text-align:left">I have enjoyed video games since I was a little kid but it's mostly action video games that I go for. Now I usually play fighting or shooting games</p>
<p style="text-align:left">such as: Call of Duty: Black-Ops 1/2 (where I typically play zombies mode), Halo Reach, Street Fighters Vs. Tekken, etc..</p>
