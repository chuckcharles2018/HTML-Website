<h1>Vacations/Crazy Experiences</h1>
<h3>West Virginia Zoo</h3>

<br><br><br><br><br>
<p style="text-align:right">One day during summer vacation after my sophomore year, going into my junior year, my family decided to go to West Virginia for</p> 
<p style="text-align:right">the West Virginia Zoo. It wasn't nearly as big as the Columbus Zoo and Aqauriam, but there was a black swan there that wasn't enclosed</p>

<p style="text-align:right">by a habitat, that I got a little too close to, that started chasing me until I got far enough away from it. Just as the traumatizing</p>
<p style="text-align:right">moment was finishing up I turn to my loving family to see them all cracking up, but how could I be mad when it was my fault, so I joined in on the laughter.</p>

<h2 style="text-align:right">Disney World</h2>

<p style="text-align:left;">I went with the Central Crossing Marching Band to Disney World in March of 2017. It was also the first time I had ever gone to Disney World.</p>
<p style="text-align:left">It was really fun and a completely different experience from anything I had done before. It was the first time I had ever been at an amusement</p>
<p style="text-align:left">park where there was entertainment while you wait to get on the ride. My favorite ride definitely had to be Mission: Space in Epcot</p>
<p style="text-align:left">because of how well the spaceship simulation felt. I also did my promposal to my girlfriend there in front of the castle at Magic Kingdom.</p>

<h3>Washington D.C</h3>
<img src="Website Pictures/Jefferson.png" alt="Jefferson Memorial" style="float:left;width:270px;height:180px;">
<p style="text-align:right">In the summer of 2017 I went on a tour with the All Star-Brass and Percussion in Washington D.C. where we played at the different memorials</p>
<p style="text-align:right">there. The memorials we played at included: the Jefferson Memorial, the Lincoln Memorial, the Washington Memorial, and so on. The first day</p>
<p style="text-align:right">of our tour we played at an armed forces ritirement home which was really awesome! We also got to sit in on one of the army band practices.</p>
<p style="text-align:right">Even though we were on tour we still got a lot of time to explore Washington D.C. when we weren't playing at a memorial, which allowed me to go</p>
<p style="text-align:right">places, like: the capitol building, the air and space museum, etc.</p>
