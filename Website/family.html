<h1>My Family and People Close to Me</h1>
<h3>Miguel Dominguez</h3>
<img src="Website Pictures/Dad.jpg" alt="Dad" class="left">
<br><br>
<p style="text-align:right">My dad. He works at Central Point Motor Co. and has worked there for about 14 years now. He taught me how to be behind the wheel.</p> 
<p style="text-align:right">He has always been there for me. He's been a big part of the reason of why I am who I am.</p>
<br><br><br>
<h3 style="text-align:right">Maria Dominguez</h3>
<img src="Website Pictures/Mom.jpg" alt="Mom" class="right">
<br><br>
<p style="text-align:left">My mom. She has helped me with creating a lot of my morals and values along with my dad. She has supported me in many occassions.</p>
<p style="text-align:left">I know that whenever I need someone to talk to that I can always count on her.</p>
<br><br><br>
<h3>Ashley Dominguez</h3>
<img src="Website Pictures/Ashley.jpg" alt="Sister" class="left">
<br><br>
<p style="text-align:right">My sister. She always gives me someone to talk about the most random things, if needed, that usually end up being quite fun!</p>
<p style="text-align:right">She's typically three years younger than me, which is great, because it gave me the chance to share at least one of my high school years with her!</p>
<br><br><br>
<h3 style="text-align:right">Christopher Dominguez</h3>
<img src="Website Pictures/Chris.jpg" alt="Brother" class="right">
<br><br> 
<p style="text-align:left">My brother. He may be a goofball but that usually gives me someone to be a goofball with. This really helps me still feel like</p>
<p style="text-align:left">a little kid when I just get tired of being a teen.</p>
<br><br><br>
<h3>Osito</h3>
<img src="Website Pictures/Osito.jpg" alt="Osito" class="left">
<br><br>
<p style="text-align:right">The father, and older one, of my two dogs. He's been a part of the family for about 5 years now and has been the first dog my</p>
<p style="text-align:right">family has had. He as loyal as they get. He may do something that'll get in trouble and he'll ask to be petted, even after just getting punished.</p>
<br><br><br>
<h3 style="text-align:right">Toby</h3>
<img src="Website Pictures/Toby.png" alt="Toby" class="right">
<br>
<p style="text-align:left">The little rascal, and Osito's son. We really enjoyed having Osito around, but he seemed to need a buddy, so my family decided to keep one</p>
<p style="text-align:left">of the pups out of the litter Osito had. Although he's Osito's son though, they are quite different, nevertheless, they still get along quite well. While Osito </p>
<p style="text-align:left">tends to be calm inside the house, Toby tends to jump off the walls and be quite hyperactive. When their outside, Osito tends to be hyperactive, and Toby is calm.</p>
<br><br><br>
<h3>Zack Ronevich</h3>

<p style="text-align:right">We're still really close and I can always count on him to cheer my day by making me laugh my socks off.</p>
<br><br><br>
